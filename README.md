# UsedMarket Website
A monolithic dynamic e-commerce / C-2-C website for an academic project.
Developed with PHP, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript and SQL. Using Apache, MySQL and phpMyAdmin with XAMPP for testing.
Some planning, diagrams and documentation can be found in the "extra" folder.

Project requirements:
* C-2-C
* RBAC
* Different admin levels and functionality
* Secure login
* Desktop and mobile friendly UI
* Mock payment system
* Data validation / Error handling

There are definitely improvements that can be made and features that can be completed, like:
* Using a framework like Laravel instead of having it as a monolith
* Moving the admin codes into the database for safekeeping
* Completing all admin level dashboards
* Adding functionality to report download buttons
